# Hi, I'm Ibrahim! ðŸ‘‹ and this is a
Machine Learning Project on Titanic Survival Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis
## Dataset
The RMS Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived.

### Data Set Column Descriptions
- pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- survived: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- name: Name
- sex: Sex
- age: Age
- sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- fare: Passenger fare (British pound)
- cabin: Cabin number, which looks like â€˜C123â€™ (the letter refers to the deck)
- embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- boat
- body
- home.dest

The full dataset is obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/jafarijason/my-datascientise-handcode/tree/master/005-datavisualization)

## Exploratory Data Analysis EDA
- How age and sex affect survival?
- How passenger class affects survival?
- Does having relatives on the ship affect survival?

## Feature Engineering
- Missing Data Handling
    - Filling missing ages 
    - Filling missing embarked
- Create new features 
    - Extract deck number from cabin number
    - Extract titles out of names (Mr, Ms, etc..)
- Convert float "fare" to integer
- Gender Encoding
- Embarked Encoding
- Age Categorization

        df['age'] = df['age'].astype(int)
        df.loc[ df['age'] <= 11, 'age'] = 0
        df.loc[(df['age'] > 11) & (df['age'] <= 18), 'age'] = 1
        df.loc[(df['age'] > 18) & (df['age'] <= 22), 'age'] = 2
        df.loc[(df['age'] > 22) & (df['age'] <= 27), 'age'] = 3
        df.loc[(df['age'] > 27) & (df['age'] <= 33), 'age'] = 4
        df.loc[(df['age'] > 33) & (df['age'] <= 40), 'age'] = 5
        df.loc[(df['age'] > 40) & (df['age'] <= 66), 'age'] = 6
        df.loc[ df['age'] > 66, 'age'] = 6

- Fare Categorization

        df.loc[ df['fare'] <= 7.91, 'fare'] = 0
        df.loc[(df['fare'] > 7.91) & (df['fare'] <= 14.454), 'fare'] = 1
        df.loc[(df['fare'] > 14.454) & (df['fare'] <= 31), 'fare']   = 2
        df.loc[(df['fare'] > 31) & (df['fare'] <= 99), 'fare']   = 3
        df.loc[(df['fare'] > 99) & (df['fare'] <= 250), 'fare']   = 4
        df.loc[ df['fare'] > 250, 'fare'] = 5
        df['fare'] = df['fare'].astype(int)
